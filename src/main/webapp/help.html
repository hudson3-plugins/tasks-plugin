<p>Jenkins can scan workspace files for open tasks, like TODO or
FIXME markers or @deprecated tags. When this option is configured,
Jenkins can provide useful information about open tasks, such as
historical result trend, web UI for viewing the tasks, and so on.</p>
<p>This plug-in is not invoked for failed builds, it is only called
for stable or unstable builds (i.e., a build with failed tests).</p>
