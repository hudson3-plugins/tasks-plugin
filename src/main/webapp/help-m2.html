<p>Hudson can scan the files in your source and resource folders for
open tasks, like TODO or FIXME markers or @deprecated tags. When this
option is configured, Hudson can provide useful information about open
tasks, such as historical result trend, web UI for viewing the tasks,
and so on. Note that no special maven goal is required to activate this
plug-in, it is automatically called after the first maven goal has been
finished.</p>
<p>This plug-in is not invoked for failed builds, it is only called
for stable or unstable builds (i.e., a build with failed tests).</p>
